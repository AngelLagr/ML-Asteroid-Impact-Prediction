# Asteroid Impact Prediction with Machine Learning

## Description  
As many of you have probably heard, the asteroid 2024 YR4 has been getting some serious attention lately, with a reported 3% chance of colliding with Earth. Naturally, I couldnâ€™t resist diving into this topic myself and figuring out if we should really be worried.

So, I set out to see if I could use machine learning to predict whether asteroids like YRA are dangerous or not. The goal? To create a model that can classify asteroids based on their orbital parameters (like diameter, eccentricity, etc.) and determine if they pose a threat to our planet.

For this, I used a Random Forest Classifier to crunch the numbers, but, of course, the data wasnâ€™t balanced. To make sure everything was fair, I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to boost the minority class and RandomUnderSampler for under-sampling.

## Project Structure  
- **`train_and_try_model.py`**: Contains the whole code to generate the model and test it but you'll need to download the database (look below)

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.11**  
- **scikit-learn**
- **imblearn** (SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler)  
- **joblib**
- **pandas**

## Download the database
**Either you download it directly on kaggle :** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset/data

**Either you use their library on python :**

First execute this command for your conda env :
```bash
pip install kagglehub[pandas-datasets]
```
And add these codelines to the train_and_try_model.py (that will replace the data = pd.read_csv(...))
```bash
import kagglehub
from kagglehub import KaggleDatasetAdapter

# Set the path to the file you'd like to load
file_path = ""

# Load the latest version
df = kagglehub.load_dataset(
  KaggleDatasetAdapter.PANDAS,
  "sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset",
  file_path,
  # Provide any additional arguments like 
  # sql_query or pandas_kwargs. See the 
  # documenation for more information:
  # https://github.com/Kaggle/kagglehub/blob/main/README.md#kaggledatasetadapterpandas
)
```

## Execution   
```bash
python train_and_try_model.py
```

## Results
Here's where it gets interesting. We ran the model with all the fancy preprocessing, and we want to know if our model will be able to predict the threat that represent the asteroid 2024 YRA. 

So here are the results I've obtained:

- Accuracy: 0.9999 ðŸ˜² (it's almost too good to be true!)
- Precision: 0.9766
- Recall: 0.9843
- F1 Score: 0.9804

And the confusion matrix:
```bash
[[59870     3]
 [    2   125]]
```
We threw in some testing with a really threatening asteroid we've seen from the past and the infamous 2024 YR4.

For the dangerous asteroid: BAM! It was correctly flagged as Dangerous.

For YRA 2024? The model predicted it as Non-Dangerous. Phew! ðŸ˜…

So, no need to start building your fallout shelters just yet! We've got the cosmic threat under control... for now.

## Disclaimer
Now, let's not get carried away here, I'm not a professional astronomer or cosmic danger expert, just an engineering student dabbling with machine learning. While the model's results look pretty solid, nothing here is really 100% accurate and there's a lot of paramaters not taken into account. So, unfortunately, weâ€™ll still have to wait a bit before we can say for sure if weâ€™re a 100% safe or not :( !
